The role social media plays in mental health


Human beings are social creatures. 

Being socially connected to others can ease stress, anxiety, and depression, boost self-worth, provide comfort and joy, prevent loneliness, and even add years to your life.
On the flip side, lacking strong social connections can pose a serious risk to your mental and emotional health.
In today’s world, many of us rely on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, YouTube, and Instagram to find and connect with each other. 


The positive aspects of social media
While virtual interaction on social media doesn’t have the same psychological benefits as face-to-face contact, there are still many positive ways in which it can help you stay connected and support your wellbeing.

Social media enables you to:

Communicate and stay up to date with family and friends around the world.
Find new friends and communities; network with other people who share similar interests or ambitions.
Join or promote worthwhile causes; raise awareness on important issues.
Seek or offer emotional support during tough times.
Find vital social connection if you live in a remote area, for example, or have limited independence, social anxiety, or are part of a marginalized group.
Find an outlet for your creativity and self-expression.
Discover (with care) sources of valuable information and learning.




The negative aspects of social media
multiple studies have found a strong link between heavy social media and an increased risk for 
depression 
anxiety
loneliness 
self-harm 
suicidal thoughts
Inadequacy about your life or appearance. 
Fear of missing out (FOMO) and social media addiction.
Isolation.
Depression and anxiety.
Cyberbullying.
Self-absorption. 
Many of us use social media as a “security blanket”. 
Your heavy social media use could be masking other underlying problems
Excessive social media use can create a negative, self-perpetuating cycle:

When you feel lonely, depressed, anxious, or stressed, you use social media more often—as a way to relieve boredom or feel connected to others.
Using social media more often, though, increases FOMO and feelings of inadequacy, dissatisfaction, and isolation.
In turn, these feelings negatively affect your mood and worsen symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.
These worsening symptoms cause you to use social media even more, and so the downward spiral continues.
Being distracted at school or work
Spending more time on social media than with real world friends
Comparing yourself unfavorably with others on social media
Experiencing cyberbullying. 
Having no time for self-reflection
Engaging in risky behavior in order to gain likes,
Suffering from sleep problems
Worsening symptoms of anxiety or depression
